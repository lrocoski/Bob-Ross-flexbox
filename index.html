                <p>Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world.</p>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Let your imagination be your guide. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. You gotta think like a tree. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.</p>

                <p>That's a son of a gun of a cloud. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. This is your world. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Let's get wild today. It takes dark in order to show light. Fluff that up. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.</p>
